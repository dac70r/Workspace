# BH1750 - GY302 Light Sensor 

This repository showcases the operation of a ambient light sensor, sampling and outputing the light intensity in units of luminosity (lux). 

An algorithm was written to convert the raw data collected into lux. Several other supporting libraries were included. The sources codes may be downloaded and modified. In this case, all codes were running on an STM32F103VET6 based microcontroller.
