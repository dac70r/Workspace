This is part 1 of a project that demonstrates the SPI transmission of data from one microcontroller to another. 2 microcontrollers required for this project. This is the master device, slave device and code can be found in the repo.

This project in particular features a NUCLEO144 - STM32H755ZIT6 based microcontroller acting as a transmit only master device (via SPI).
