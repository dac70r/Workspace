This is part 2 of a project that demonstrates the SPI transmission of data from one microcontroller to another. 2 microcontrollers required for this project. This is the slave device, master device and code can be found in the repo.

This project in particular features a stm32f103vet6 based microcontroller acting as a receive of slave device (via SPI).
